Advent of Code solutions written in Go.

## Usage
### Creating a new day
This package comes with template files for each day, in order to quickly create a new day run:
```console
make day -day=[day] -year=[year]
```

### Testing solutions
Each AoC puzzle has an example input along with the expected outcome, in order to test your solution paste the provided input into `input_test.txt` for the day, cd into the day directory and run `go test -v`.

## A note on puzzle inputs
Your puzzle input should be pasted into the `input.txt` file for each day.

Puzzle inputs are not included in this repository, this is a request from the AoC team.
